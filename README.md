# Smart Carbon Footprint Tracker with Predictive Analytics and Gamification

## 1. Problem Statement
Individuals and organizations often lack actionable insights into their carbon footprint. Our solution will track, predict, and reduce carbon footprints using AI/ML, IoT, and gamification techniques.

## 2. Project Overview
A web-based platform with the following features:

- **Real-time Carbon Tracking**: Uses IoT to monitor energy consumption and predict emissions.
- **Predictive Analytics**: AI models predict future carbon footprints based on user habits.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Rewards users with tradable "green credits" for sustainable actions.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Displays live data on energy use, emissions, and suggestions for improvement.

## 3. Technology Stack

### Backend and Core Logic
- **Python** for development.
- **Flask/FastAPI** for API endpoints.
- **Blockchain**: Solidity for smart contracts (Ethereum or Polygon).
- **IoT Integration**: Use Python libraries like PySerial or MQTT to connect IoT devices.

### AI/ML Models
- **Predictive Analytics**: Scikit-learn or TensorFlow to forecast energy usage and emissions.
- **Carbon Reduction Suggestions**: NLP-based recommendation system (Hugging Face).

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** for user data and IoT logs.
- **IPFS** (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized storage of rewards and carbon certificates.

### Frontend (Dashboard)
- **Streamlit** or **Dash** for live analytics.
- **Plotly/Chart.js** for interactive visualizations.

### Cloud Hosting
- Host on **AWS** or **Google Cloud** for scalability.

## 4. Features and Workflow

### Feature 1: Real-time Carbon Footprint Tracker
- IoT Sensors (simulated or real) monitor energy usage in homes/offices.
- Use MQTT/Flask API to send live data to the backend.

### Feature 2: Predictive Analytics
- Train AI models to predict future energy usage trends based on historical data.
- Provide users with insights and actionable steps to reduce emissions.

### Feature 3: Blockchain-based Green Credits
- Assign "green credits" for sustainable actions (e.g., reducing energy usage by 20%).
- Use smart contracts to trade green credits for vouchers or donations to environmental causes.

### Feature 4: Interactive Dashboard
- Display:
  - Live energy usage (charts/graphs).
  - Emission trends and predictions.
  - Gamified leaderboard showing top performers in reducing carbon footprints.

## 5. Task Division

### Backend Development
- Flask APIs (real-time IoT data integration).
- Blockchain integration for green credits (smart contract deployment).
- AI/ML model training for predictions.

### Frontend Development
- Design and deploy the Streamlit/Dash dashboard.
- Implement charts for live data and predictions.

### IoT/Hardware Integration (if applicable)
- Simulate sensor data (if real IoT devices are unavailable).
- Send data to the backend via MQTT/HTTP protocols.

### Presentation
- Prepare a compelling pitch with slides explaining the problem, solution, technologies, and impact.
- Include a live demo of the platform.
